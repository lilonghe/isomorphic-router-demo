$ cd isomorphic-router-demo
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Demo

## Motivation

This is a demo project to show you how to set up an isomorphic webapp using [React Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [`react-router-config`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config).

The app has a few pages:

1. The Home page, which includes two sets of dynamic loading to server APIs to grab JSON data to be displayed on the page. This is achieved via isomorphic-fetch. One isomorphic-fetch returns the same JSON data every time and the other one returns a different JSON each time.
2. The About page
3. The NotFound page, which gets rendered anytime an unrecognized route is requested.

## App Building Blocks

```
├── build
|  └── main.bundle.js   <=== A2
├── client
|  └── main.js   <=== B2
├── iso-middleware
|  └── renderRoute.js  <=== A4
├── package.json
├── .babelrc
├── .env
├── server
|  ├── run.js
|  └── server.js  <=== A5
├── shared
|  ├── App.js   <=== B3
|  ├── components
|  |  ├── About.js
|  |  ├── HTML.js   <=== A3
|  |  ├── TopNav.js   <=== B4
|  |  ├── Home.js
|  |  ├── Main.js   <=== B5
|  |  └── NotFound.js
|  └── routes.js <=== B6
└── webpack.config.js <=== A1, B1
```

Notes:

* Server Render: **A**  
	* A1. `webpack.config.js` creates `/build/main.bundle.js` when the app is first built.
	* A2. `main.bundle.js` is used in `HTML.js`
	* A3. `HTML.js` is a React component used to generate the template HTML that the server sends to the browser when it gets an HTTP `GET` request from the browser (called the initial load).
	* A4. `renderRoute.js` renders a static version of the `App` (using the `StaticRouter` as a container) into the HTML template in `HTML.js`, converts everything to string using React's server rendering support, then send the final string version of the HTML to send for HTTP GET request.
	* A5. `server.js` responds to the initial load request by getting `renderRoutes` to respond with an HTML.

* Client Render: **B**
	* B1. `webpack.config.js` identifies the entry point for the client app as `main.js`
	* B2. `main.js` renders a SPA version of the app using `BrowserRouter` as container for `App`.
	* B3. `App` includes a `TopNav` and a `Main`.
	* B4. `TopNav` contains React Router `Link` components, which navigates to the route upon click.
	* B5. `Main` contains a React Router `Switch` component, which switches between the `Home`, `About`, and `NotFound` components depending on the route.
	* B6. `routes.js` determines the mapping between routes and the `Home`, `About`, and `NotFound` components.


## Isomorphic Webapp Concepts

* **Initial Load**:  The HTML that server gets an initial request via a HTTP GET request. The server grabs what it needs to render the HTML, such as data from a database or static assets like images, then sends HTML to the browser.
* **SPA mode**: After initial load, the page should immediately enters Single Page Application (SPA) mode. In SPA mode:
	* The app can support quick navigation between pages without refreshing the page, and if done right, can even work offline.
	* Updates are initiated by events, such as mouse clicks or scroll from the user.
	* Additional data can by grabbed by talking to an API. The server serves up data, usually as JSON, to an api endpoint (RESTful API or GraphQL).
